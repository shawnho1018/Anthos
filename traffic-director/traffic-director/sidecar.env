# Set this to 'true', to explicitly add a netfilter rule that excludes traffic
# originated by ENVOY_USER from being intercepted and sent back to Envoy. Set
# this to empty '' when Envoy runs under the same user as the app. It's
# recommended to set this to empty only when SERVICE_CIDR below is explicitly
# set to intercept only the VIPs (IPs) of services, and service VIPs are not
# supposed to overlap with backend IPs. When this is set to 'true', make sure
